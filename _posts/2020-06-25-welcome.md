I am a postgraduate in the Department of International History at the London School of Economics and Political Science (2021), and in the School of International Studies at Peking University (2020). [Here]({{http://deliyang.github.io}}/assets/cv.pdf) is the latest version of my C.V.

My research lies in diplomatic signaling and international security. Topics on which I have published or am currently working include the intersection between political apologies and post-war reconciliation, as well as the intersection of secret diplomacy and conflict management.
